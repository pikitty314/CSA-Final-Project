# Inspiration
Much of this game was inspired by another world defense game called Four Days, especially the mechanic where you can place towers anywhere to reroute the enemies. Unfortunately, it seems like that game has been pulled from both the App Store and Play Store (trademarks of Apple and Google respectively).
